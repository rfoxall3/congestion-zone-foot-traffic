# congestion-zone
The ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file contains the commented and sectioned code used for this project. The code uses the Dewey API endpoint to read data on foot traffic, then analyzes foot traffic within NYC's Congestion Relief Zone by Census block group by day for January 2024 and January 2025. The code outputs a CSV file with total change per area for weekends and weekdays as well as a shapefile with the Census block group geometry and total change in foot traffic from 2024 to 2025.
